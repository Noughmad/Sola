Liquid crystal waveguides have a wide array of applications, owing mainly to their optical properties and possibility of control by external fields. We present results of a simulation of light propagation through cylindrical liquid crystal waveguides with various director profiles. Our work is based on a Finite-differente time-domain method, coupled with numerical minimization of the phenomenological Landau-de Gennes free energy. We show eigenmodes for waveguides with a radial director, an escaped radial director, and a double-twist cylinder profile. We study the effects or varying waveguide size, light wavelength and field strenth on eigenmodes. Finally, we investigate leakage caused by droplets attached to the waveguide.
