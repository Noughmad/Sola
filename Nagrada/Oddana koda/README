== Qt-based plot framework for Orange ==

My project is divided into four major parts:
 - Part of the framework written in C++ (folder 'orangeqt')
 - Part of the framework written in Python (folder 'plot')
 - Changing a number of existing visualizations to use the new framework (folder 'Visualize Qt')
 - Documentation and examples (folder 'doc')

The third part (visualizations) only includes changes made by me, because most of the non-plotting logic was written by other authors. 
The rest were written almost entirely by me, so they are included as whole files. 

Additionally, I made some small changes to other code files, to remove Qwt dependency or to ensure compatibility with my new modules. 
The most important changes are included in the 'other' folder. 

= Getting the update code =

I plan to continue working for Orange after the end of this program, so it is likely that the final result will be different from the submitted code. 
The current development version can be downloaded from the subversion repository with:

svn up http://orange.biolab.si/svn/orange/trunk

The folders with my contributions in trunk are:
 - source/orangeqt/
 - orange/OrangeWidget/plot/
 - orange/OrangeWidget/Visualize Qt/
 - orange/doc/widgets/
 - orange/doc/Orange/rst/

Note that somebody else (Matej Drame) worked on a similar project (3D plots) during the summer. Most of the folders mentioned above contain his code as 
well.
